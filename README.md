Fix Music Filenames

CDs mostly use a filename format: "[artists] - [track] - [title].[extension]"

Unfortunately, no music player I've come across supports this format, leading to tracks being played out of order.  I've emailed several vendors, none seem to be aware of the issue, at best the request is placed on the backlog.

This program helps create a parallel directory with hard-linked files with "corrected" names.
