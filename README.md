Fix Music Filenames

CDs mostly use a filename format: "[artists] - [track] - [title].[extension]"

Unfortunately, no music play I've come across supports this format.  I've emailed several, at best, the request is placed on the backlog.

This program helps create a parallel directory with hard-linked files with "corrected" names.
